# Binary Patching

We provide here some examples of how to use Patcherex to patch binaries implementing DNNs.

These samples require `Patcherex`.
To install `Patcherex` runs the following commands **in the same virtual environment where DnD was installed**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angr/patcherex -b feat/evk --depth 1
pip install -U pip
cd patcherex
pip install -e .
```
